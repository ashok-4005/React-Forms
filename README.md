# React Forms

This project is a basic React application that demonstrates how to handle form submissions using functional components and the FormData API. The form collects user input such as email, password, a description, employment status (via radio buttons), mode of transport (via checkboxes), and a favorite color (via a dropdown). On submission, the form data is collected, including multiple checkbox selections using formData.getAll(), and logged to the console. This example showcases how to manage mixed input types and handle form events in a React-friendly way without using external form libraries.
